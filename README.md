# Dynamix Three SpaceBlender Addon
Import Dynamix Three Space (DTS) models from Torque3D into Blender
It can import 2 UV channels, vertex colors, object position and rotation

## Installation
1. Grab the latest `io_scene_dtst3d.zip` here https://github.com/Dummiesman/DynamixThreeSpaceBlenderAddon/releases
2. In Blender, select Edit > Preferences
3. Select the Add-Ons tab
4. Click Install in the top right corner
5. Select the ZIP file


**Important:** The add-on was developed on Blender 3.6. While it's not a strict requirement you use this version, other versions may not work correctly. I have tested it on Blender 4.1 briefely and it appeared to work, however.
