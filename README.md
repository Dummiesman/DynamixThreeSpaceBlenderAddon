# Dynamix Three SpaceBlender Addon
Import Dynamix Three Space (DTS) models from Torque3D into Blender
It can import 2 UV channels, vertex colors, object position and rotation

It can import material names, but material parameters (such as color) are not currently imported

## Version Support
Versions 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26 should function.

The code is based off the Torque3D source code so adding in newer versions should be relatively easy

## Installation
1. Grab the latest `io_scene_dtst3d.zip` here https://github.com/Dummiesman/DynamixThreeSpaceBlenderAddon/releases
2. In Blender, select Edit > Preferences
3. Select the Add-Ons tab
4. Click Install in the top right corner
5. Select the ZIP file


**Important:** The add-on was developed on Blender 3.6. While it's not a strict requirement you use this version, other versions may not work correctly. I have tested it on Blender 4.1 briefely and it appeared to work, however.
